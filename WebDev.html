<p>The Web Development Track is lead by Priscilla and AnnMarie.
  They are both super fun to be around and they are very down to earth.
  They are also great teachers, and they ensure that you always understand eveything.
  We do a daily review to make sure everyone in the track knows how to do everything and how everything works.
  In the WebDev track we learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
